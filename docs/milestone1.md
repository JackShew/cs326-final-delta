Data Interactions:  There will be two main roles, users and admins. Users will be able manipulate upvote, downvote, comment, pictures, and dishes data objects. Admins will be able to do everything a user can as well as organize and delete comments, pictures, and dishes. The dishes will be filtered by which dining hall they were at with the top-voted dishes shown at the top.

Division of Labor: (Just 2 of us)
Jack: created paper mockup with input from Jayden. Created initial HTML structure and made most of the body elements of the main page. 
Jayden: added the bootstrap, comments, and user pages to the site. Did the header and filters as well.

Overall the division felt very even.
