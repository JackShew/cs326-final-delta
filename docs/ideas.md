Innovative Idea -
Our project will aim to gauge quality of dishes available at the college with the #1 dining in the nation. Users will be able to add and rate dining hall dishes to our application and as well as review existing dishes. By utilizing an voting, picture, and comment protocal, prospective diners will be able to understand what the Umass community views as the best and worst dishes wherever they may grub. This application follows the crowdsourcing workflow similar to Reddit and Yikyak, but focuses solely on UMass food.

Important Components-
There will be two main roles, users and admins. Users will be able to upvote, downvote, comment, post pictures, and add dishes. Admins will be able to do everything a user can as well as organize and delete comments, pictures, and dishes. The dishes will be filtered by which dining hall they were at with the top-voted dishes shown at the top.
