Innovative Idea -
Our project will aim to gauge quality of dishes available at the college with the #1 dinning in the nation. Users will be able to add and rate dinning hall dishes to our application and as well as review existing dishes. By utilizing an voting, picture, and comment protocal, prospective dinners will be able to understand the best and worst dishes wherever they may go. This application follows the crowdsourcing workflow similar to Reddit and Yikyak, but focuses solely on UMass food.

Important Components - 
Users: Upvote, downvote, comment, post pictures, add dishes.
Admin: Create, organize, delete all the above.
Algorithm: Filter created dishes by dinning halls initally, showing the top voted options.
