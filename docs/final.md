**Team Delta Presents:**

***Grub Gauge***

A web app that programatically renders user generated and web scraped dishes from UMass's 4 dinning halls - enabling the Umass community to crowdsource the best dishes from the #1 dinning in the nation. As the only food ranking website for UMass Amherst, we want to provide the most relevant dinning information  for anyone on our campus.

**User Interface**


User Interface: A final up-to-date list/table describing your application’s user interface. This should include the name of the UI view and its purpose. You should include a screenshot of each of your UI views.
APIs: A final up-to-date list/table describing your application’s API
Database: A final up-to-date representation of your database including a brief description of each of the entities in your data model and their relationships if any.
URL Routes/Mappings: A final up-to-date table of all the URL routes that your application supports and a short description of what those routes are used for. You should also indicate any authentication and permissions on those routes.
Authentication/Authorization: A final up-to-date description of how users are authenticated and any permissions for specific users (if any) that you used in your application. You should mention how they relate to which UI views are accessible.
Division of Labor: A breakdown of the division of labor for each team member — that is, saying who did what, for the entire project. Remember that everyone is expected to contribute roughly equally to each phase of the project. We expect to see similar numbers and kinds of GitHub commits by each student.
Conclusion: A conclusion describing your team’s experience in working on this project. This should include what you learned through the design and implementation process, the difficulties you encountered, what your team would have liked to know before starting the project that would have helped you later, and any other technical hurdles that your team encountered.
